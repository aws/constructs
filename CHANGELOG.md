### Bug Fixes

### [4.1.1-pre.0](https://github.com/aws/constructs/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1-pre.0) (2020-07-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Stack traces are not attached to metadata entries by default. To include stack trace in a metadata entry, pass `{ stackTrace: true }` as the 3rd parameter, which is now of type `MetadataOptions` and not a `fromFunction` pointer.
* `construct.node.dependencies` is not transitive anymore. It returns the set of dependencies added directly to the node. The `Dependency` type has also been removed as a result since it's not needed any longer.

### Features

* addMetadata() no longer attaches stack traces by default ([2bedd90](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/2bedd907f39b64715cade2d49e94a9978930bc56))
* IDependable ([d11bd33](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/d11bd339aed3cad000d07fdd8ef7d2741153935a))
* traceFromFunction in addMetadata() ([46652b0](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/46652b04d81e5a0031be5a5f48fe713ce47a8765))

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/aws/constructs/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0) (2020-07-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* to add validation logic for constructs, implement the `IValidation` interface. 
* The `construct.node.validate()` method no longer validates the entire tree, but only the specific construct on which it is called.
* constructs no longer have an `onPrepare()` and `onSynthesis()` hooks. See domain-specific (such as AWS CDK and cdk8s) for alternatives.
* aspects are no longer supported as part of the constructs library, so `node.applyAspect()` is no longer available. The AWS CDK implements aspects through `Aspects.of(construct).apply()`.

### Features

* aspect are no longer supported ([ffe8cf6](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/ffe8cf6c4dbcb67b25d874028c09a04ed68e264c))
* introduce IValidation instead of onValidate() ([c99d198](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/c99d198bca8698c19e88cd53fb8393fb4ec50bed))
* remove onPrepare() and onSynthesize() ([a312b34](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/a312b3455227ba25853eece6a3a588d67a3edb4c))

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/aws/constructs/compare/v3.0.4...v4.0.0) (2020-07-05)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `Node.of(construct)` was replaced with `construct.node`.

### Features

* construct.node ([6e4b278](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/6e4b2783764ec4155f858b22751804ffe7587f5a))

### [3.0.4](https://github.com/aws/constructs/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4) (2020-06-24)

### [3.0.3](https://github.com/aws/constructs/compare/v1.1.4...v3.0.3) (2020-05-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `Token` class as well as all related elements
(`IResolvable`, etc...) were removed from this release. The feature may
be re-introduced in the future, but was pulled due to causing conflicts
with overlapping implementations in some consumers.

* add facility to validate construct ids

* Updated version number to 3.0.0

* PR feedback

* Removed Construct ID validator

* Update package.json
